<!-- provide some background information -->
<h1>Background Information</h1>

    <p>Hi my name is Ashley Laird and I'm very excited to change my career to software engineering. My background is mainly around accounting and Finance as I obtained a degree in accounting and finance and then went to work in construction as an Accounts Assistant, before moving to current company in the fintech industry as a Learning and Development Manager. While working in the fintech industry, and working with many engineers and developers, I decided this was a career I would like to persue. I am currently partaking on a software engineering Bootcamp with HyperionDev which I am thoroughly enjoying.</p>
    <p>In my spare time, I love being outdoors. Living in Scotland means there are plenty of scenic hills to climb and I really enjoy tackling the hard munros. I also enjoy Paddle-boarding and getting to as many gym classes a week as I can.</p>
    <p>In general, I am very keen and ambitious. I also set out goals for myself and never really rest until I achieve them. These goals are which keep me highly motivated.</p>
